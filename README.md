# Rochambeau

Rock-Paper-Scissors game with simple buttons for rock, paper, and scissors. The player and computer will play for 5 rounds and on each round a winner will be displayed, after the 5th round the overall winner will be announced.  
  
This simple project showcases my acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Utilizing HTML img and div tags, and using div tags to act as a button.
* In CSS I applied flex to properly display the divs as rows and providing space for them evenly.
* In the JavaScript part, I made use of click event listeners for each button. Utilized objects to make counter variables, getters, and setters. Applied my knowledge of functions, arrays, conditionals, loops, and DOM manipulation.
